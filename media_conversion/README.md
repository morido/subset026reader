The two files in this directory are macros which can be used together with Visio and Word to convert shapes and images contained in `*.doc`-files.
A message will be generated by the tool if such postprocessing is necessary.

* `shapeExtractor.doc` can handle the file `shapes.csv`
* `imageConversion.vsd` processes `images.csv`
