Preconverted ReqIF files may be found in [this](https://github.com/morido/subset026reqif) supplemental repository.

The tool itself is licenced under the EUPL V.1.1. It makes use of 

* [Apache POI](http://poi.apache.org) which is licenced under Apache Licence 2.0
* The [Stanford NLP Parser](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml) licenced under GPLv2

This software was written in the frame of the ITEA2 project [openETCS](http://www.openetcs.org). Besides the included Javadoc, there is extensive documentation available through an accompanying Diploma Thesis:

**On the domain-specific formalization of requirement specifications - A case study of ETCS**

This paper will soon be published through [Qucosa](http://www.qucosa.de).
